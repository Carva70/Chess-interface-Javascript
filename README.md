# Chess-interface-Javascript

This program is a chess game that can be played against an AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves and a heuristic function to evaluate the board position.

Usage
-----

To use this chess program, you will need to have a web browser and a local development environment set up.

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    
2.  Open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a chess board displayed on the page.
    
3.  To make a move, simply click and drag a piece on the board to the desired location. The computer will automatically make its move after you release the piece.
    
4.  The program uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves. The search depth can be adjusted by modifying the "limit" variable in the code.
    
5.  The program also includes a heuristic function to evaluate the board position. You can also adjust the quiescence search limit by modifying the "quiesenceLimit" variable.
    
6.  Each move made by the computer will be accompanied by the minimax prediction, the heuristic value, and the number of nodes visited during the search.
    
7.  The game can be reset by refreshing the page.
